# Drum Kit - A working drumkit that you can play!

This project was originally featured on [30 Days of Javascript](https://javascript30.com) by Wes Bos. Originally a code-along exercise, I updated it to work with mobile devices and touch, in addition to PC keyboards. Coded with HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

## My process


### Built with

- Vanilla Javascript
- Sass
- Visual Studio Code
- Chrome



### What I learned

This was a fun project to work on. I started the building blocks of learning how to use Sass to compile my CSS. (Those nested style arguments are extremely helpful!) 

I also had to learn the difference between a click event, a key event, and a touch event. Which in the long run will be very helpful as mostly everyone uses a mobile device these days.



### Useful resources
