# React Drum Kit - A working drumset that you can play, now created with React!

This project was originally featured on [30 Days of Javascript](https://javascript30.com) by Wes Bos. Originally a code-along exercise, I deconstructed it, updated it, and recreated it to run with React. This was a fantastic project for me to complete, and I had a lot of fun making it. Coded with HTML, SASS, Javascript, and React.
